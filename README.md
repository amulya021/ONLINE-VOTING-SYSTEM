# ONLINE-VOTING-SYSTEM
The project's goal is to develop and manage polling and election details. This is a method that allows all citizens to vote online. The primary objective of this initiative is to increase the percentage of people who vote across the country. To vote under the current system, people must go to a polling place across the country. Because this method is online, persons who live outside of their home town can vote as well. The system keeps a database of all eligible citizens and candidates. We used Django framework and visual studio code, html and CSS for the frontend, python for the backend, and MYSQL for database storage.
